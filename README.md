# CS 320: Translating User Needs Into Quality Software

### How can I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure?

Writing clean code and developing effective tests are the most important aspects of ensuring that a project is functional and secure—and has minimal errors and defects that could lead to failure. Some major characteristics of "clean" code include an adherence to widely used conventions, being efficient to refactor, and being easily comprehensible to other developers. Encapsulating sensitive data is also important for improving the security of software. Collectively, these practices will greatly reduce code “smells” that can negatively affect projects. Additionally, the development of effective unit tests can play a chief role in the process of producing functional and secure software.

### How do I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program?

Observation and facilitating feedback seem to be essential aspects of meeting users’ needs during software development. The process of documenting users’ relevant activities "in the field" provides a good example of this. Also, the use of an iterative development methodology can offer a good environment for incorporating consistent user feedback into a project's development pipeline. Furthermore, utilizing visual aids and gamification have proven to be useful for translating requirements into tangible software models. Examples of this include user stories with story points and various diagrams—use-case, data flow, UML, etc.

### How do I approach designing software?

I believe that software design needs to be approached in a structured manner that complements the strengths of each developer/team and is relevant to the specific project. A restaurant ordering system might be approached differently than an online e-commerce portal. One consistent element between most software projects is the benefit that adopting an iterative framework—like Agile Scrum—can provide. This allows initial concepts to be fleshed out and tested through rapid iterations of development. It has proven to be an effective process for numerous organizations. Undoubtedly, some of the effectiveness of the "Agile" approach is due to the methodology’s ubiquity, which allows various developers to collaborate under a mutually understood and adopted set of principles. 

Designing software in this manner involves iteratively: 

* Gathering requirements

* Planning project details around these requirements—including its events and artifacts

* Designing concrete aspects of a project—such as relevant diagrams

* Coding and testing components of the project

* Integrating those components and testing the project holistically 

* Releasing the project—which often involves more testing and development throughout that project’s complete lifecycle.
